Computer-Aided Skin Cancer Diagnosis (ResNet + Web App)

*A college deep learning project that started as coursework but became an intense experiment in real-world medical AI.*

---

## 📌 About the Project

This project began as a part of our **Deep Learning elective coursework** in my 4th semester (Jan–May 2025). I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of AI and healthcare, so I took up **automated skin cancer classification** — a topic I quickly realized was much more complex than it looked on the surface.

I initially started with standard **CNN models**, but the results were unstable, especially for rare classes like vascular lesions. After a lot of experimentation, I shifted to **ResNet-50** — a deeper model with residual blocks that made training much more stable and gave significantly better results, especially under image noise or poor contrast.

This was more than just a model training exercise — from data cleaning, preprocessing, class imbalance correction, to late-night debugging and waiting for all 50 epochs to finally run — it was a real deep dive into applied deep learning.

To complete the pipeline, I wrapped the model in a **Flask web app**, designed a simple frontend, and deployed it — so anyone could upload an image and get predictions along with Grad-CAM heatmaps to interpret the results.

## 🎯 What I Wanted to Achieve

- Train a CNN to classify **7 different types of skin lesions**
- Improve performance on underrepresented classes (e.g. AKIEC, DF)
- Implement **Grad-CAM** for visual interpretability
- Deploy a working **diagnostic demo** via Flask

---

## ✅ What I Actually Achieved

- 🧠 Trained and fine-tuned **ResNet-50** with class-weighted loss and preprocessing
- ⚙️ Achieved **84.3% accuracy** and **91% sensitivity** on test set
- 📈 Compared with **MobileNetV2** and ensemble versions
- 🔬 Used **Grad-CAM** to explain model predictions
- 🌐 Deployed a fully working **Flask web app** with image upload and live results
- 🧪 Experimented with dropout tuning, early stopping, and noise robustness tests

---

## 🔍 Technical Deep Dive

- **Model Choice**: Started with a vanilla CNN but it overfit quickly. ResNet-50 offered skip connections that helped avoid vanishing gradients and trained better on medical images.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - All images converted to **grayscale**
  - Histogram equalization to improve lesion visibility
  - Resized to **224x224**
- **Training Details**:
  - Framework: `TensorFlow + Keras`
  - Optimizer: `Adam`, LR = 1e-4 with ReduceLROnPlateau
  - Loss: `CategoricalCrossentropy` with class reweighting
  - Regularization: Dropout (0.3), EarlyStopping
- **Data Augmentation**:
  - Horizontal/vertical flips
  - Random zoom & brightness
- **Validation Strategy**:
  - 80/10/10 split (train/val/test)
  - Used stratified sampling to preserve class ratios

## 🧪 Dataset Info

* **Source**: [ISIC 2018 Challenge Dataset](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/)
* **Classes** (7 total):

  * Melanoma (MEL)
  * Nevus (NV)
  * Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)
  * Actinic Keratoses (AKIEC)
  * Benign Keratosis (BKL)
  * Dermatofibroma (DF)
  * Vascular lesions (VASC)
* **Challenge**: Very imbalanced dataset — classes like VASC and DF had <5% representation.
* **Solution**: Applied **class-weighting** in the loss function and oversampling in training batches.

## 🧠 Grad-CAM Visualizations

* Implemented Grad-CAM to visualize which parts of the lesion image influenced the model’s prediction.
* Made it **part of the live web app**, not just the notebook!
* Used `tf-keras-vis` to extract final conv layer activations and overlaid on input image.

*(Frontend only — model hosted locally for now. Full deployment coming soon!)*

---

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-cancer-diagnosis.git
cd skin-cancer-diagnosis
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app/app.py
